## ðŸ”„ CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The CI pipeline automatically runs on every push to the main branch and on pull requests.

### CI Jobs Overview

The CI pipeline consists of several jobs that run in parallel to ensure code quality:

#### 1. **Prettier Check** (`prettier`)
- **Purpose**: Ensures code formatting consistency across the project
- **Runs**: `npm run format:check`
- **Local equivalent**: `npm run format:check` (check) or `npm run format` (auto-fix)
- **What it does**: Validates that all source files follow the configured Prettier formatting rules

#### 2. **Linting** (`lint`)
- **Purpose**: Checks code quality and catches potential issues
- **Runs**: `npm run lint`
- **Local equivalent**: `npm run lint`
- **What it does**: Runs ESLint to identify code quality issues, unused variables, and potential bugs

#### 3. **Type Checking** (`typecheck`)
- **Purpose**: Validates TypeScript types without emitting files
- **Runs**: `npm run typecheck`
- **Local equivalent**: `npm run typecheck`
- **What it does**: Ensures all TypeScript code is properly typed and catches type errors

#### 4. **Unit Tests** (`unit-tests`)
- **Purpose**: Runs unit tests with coverage reporting
- **Runs**: `npm run test:coverage`
- **Local equivalent**: `npm run test:coverage` (with coverage) or `npm run test:unit` (without coverage)
- **Dependencies**: Waits for `lint`, `prettier`, and `typecheck` jobs to complete
- **What it does**: Executes all unit tests using Vitest and generates coverage reports

#### 5. **End-to-End Tests** (`e2e`)
- **Purpose**: Runs browser-based integration tests
- **Runs**: `npm run e2e:ci`
- **Local equivalent**: `npm run e2e` (with UI) or `npm run e2e:ci` (headless)
- **Dependencies**: Waits for `lint`, `prettier`, and `typecheck` jobs to complete
- **What it does**: Builds the project and runs Playwright tests to verify the application works end-to-end

#### 6. **Comprehensive Test & Build** (`test-and-build`)
- **Purpose**: Complete validation including type checking, formatting, unit tests, build, and E2E tests
- **What it does**: Runs all checks in sequence and uploads test results and build artifacts
- **Includes**: Type checking, formatting check, unit tests with coverage, build process, and E2E tests

### Running CI Commands Locally

To replicate the CI environment locally, run these commands in order:

```bash
# Install dependencies (equivalent to npm ci in CI)
npm install

# 1. Check code formatting
npm run format:check
# Or auto-fix formatting issues:
npm run format

# 2. Run linting
npm run lint

# 3. Run type checking
npm run typecheck

# 4. Run unit tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# 5. Build the project
npm run build

# 6. Install Playwright browsers (first time only)
npx playwright install --with-deps

# 7. Run E2E tests
npm run e2e:ci

# Or run everything at once:
npm run ci:test
```

### Viewing Coverage Reports

After running tests with coverage, you can view the reports in several ways:

#### Terminal Output
The coverage summary is displayed directly in the terminal after running:
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

#### HTML Coverage Report
A detailed HTML report is generated in the `coverage/` directory:
```bash
# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Open the HTML report in your browser
# On macOS:
open coverage/index.html

# On Linux:
xdg-open coverage/index.html

# On Windows:
start coverage/index.html
```

#### Coverage Artifacts in CI
- **Unit test coverage**: Uploaded as `vitest-coverage` artifact
- **E2E test results**: Uploaded as `playwright-report` artifact (on failure)
- **Build artifacts**: Uploaded as `build-artifacts` artifact

These artifacts are retained for 30 days and can be downloaded from the GitHub Actions run page.

### Troubleshooting CI Issues

**Formatting Issues:**
```bash
# Check what files have formatting issues
npm run format:check

# Fix formatting issues automatically
npm run format
```

**Linting Issues:**
```bash
# See detailed linting errors
npm run lint

# Some issues can be auto-fixed
npm run lint -- --fix
```

**Type Errors:**
```bash
# See detailed type errors
npm run typecheck

# Or use your IDE's TypeScript integration for real-time feedback
```

**Test Failures:**
```bash
# Run unit tests in watch mode for development
npm run test:unit:watch

# Run specific test files
npm run test:unit -- src/components/Book/Book.test.tsx

# Run E2E tests with UI for debugging
npm run e2e
```

**Build Issues:**
```bash
# Run build locally to see detailed errors
npm run build

# Check build output
npm run preview
```

## ðŸ§  Architecture

The application uses a functional component architecture with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS:

- `Book.tsx` - Reusable component utilizing Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Book components are content-driven and provide:
  - `bookKey` - Unique identifier for the book.
  - `pages` - Array of page objects with image and text content, all styled via Tailwind utility classes.

### Migration Rationale

With Tailwind CSS, the application has minimized the need for maintaining multiple CSS modules. The utility-first approach allows for rapid UI development with less focus on custom classes. Custom theme configurations ensure consistency in design while maintaining flexibility.

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Features

- **Rainbow Theme**: Vibrant colors and gradients throughout the application
- **Animation Effects**: Achieved through Tailwind CSS utilities
- **Child-Friendly UI**: Large touch targets and intuitive navigation
- **iPad-Optimized**: Special styling for the primary device (iPad), using Tailwind's responsive utilities
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations with Tailwind's grid system

## ðŸŽ¨ Tailwind CSS Setup

The project uses **Tailwind CSS v4** with a custom theme configuration that includes:

- **Custom Colors**: Rainbow palette with semantic color names
- **Design Tokens**: Consistent spacing, typography, and border radius values
- **Custom Animations**: Utilized through Tailwind's animation utilities
- **CSS Variables**: Both Tailwind v4 `@theme` and traditional `:root` variables for compatibility
- **Custom Utilities**: Dynamic utility classes

### Key Tailwind Features Used:
- **Utility-First Approach**: All styling done with utility classes
- **Custom Theme**: Defined in `src/index.css` using `@theme` directive
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first breakpoints for all screen sizes
- **Custom Animations**: Tailwind classes for interactive elements
- **CSS Variables**: Seamless integration with existing custom properties
