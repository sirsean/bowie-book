    text: "In a land where butterflies could color the sky,\nAnd polar bears learned, with small wings, to fly,\nMommy bear hugged Princess with bright hair so light,\nThen took to the clouds, soaring out of sight.\n\n\"I'll be back soon, my dear,\" she whispered, quite near,\nWith a promise of love, to always hold dear."

    text: "Through the cotton-candy clouds, Mommy flew fast,\nTo a land where the airplanes were vast.\nThere, with a wrench and a smile, she worked with care,\nWhile butterflies buzzed through the workshop air.\n\n\"With every twist and turn, I think of you,\nMy little princess, brave and true.\""

    text: "Then came the day, with an engine's roar,\nAn airplane took flight, with Mommy onboard to soar.\nChasing dreams and dodging a playful missile's flight,\nA butterfly co-pilot made sure all was right.\n\n\"Through skies and clouds, we dance and we weave,\nSoon I'll return, on this eve.\""

    text: "In the factory's hum, where planes are born,\nMommy inspected the wings at dawn.\nAnd though her hands checked every bolt and every gear,\nHer heart was with Princess, always near.\n\n\"My work ensures these great birds can glide,\nJust like my love for you, wide and wide.\""

    text: "With the planes ready and the bears prepared to fly,\nThey soared with the butterfly high in the sky.\nMommy's thoughts flew faster than the fleet,\nRushing home to the one she couldn't wait to meet.\n\n\"I've taught bears to soar, but now it's time,\nTo return to my princess, oh so fine.\""

    text: "Back through the clouds, to the fairy-tale land,\nMommy returned, to take Princess's hand.\nIn front of the castle, where dreams are spun,\nThey hugged beneath the golden sun.\n\n\"Here in my arms, you'll forever stay,\nMy little princess, every night and every day.\""
